"""Fallback egress for Shoonya calls when this host's IP is not the whitelisted one.

Shoonya binds API access to a registered static IP. When the line's public IP
changes — a failover, a lease renewal, a VPN drop — Shoonya answers
`Invalid Input : INVALID_IP` and nothing works. Worse, it stays invisible: the
gateway reuses a session token for the whole calendar day, so it keeps reporting
"connected" until something forces a genuine re-login, which may not be until
09:15 the next morning.

The policy here is deliberately least-effort:

    1. a cached session token, if one is still valid   (no network login at all)
    2. this host's own IP, directly                    (normal, and free)
    3. the proxy                                       (only when 1 and 2 fail)

The proxy is a fallback, never the default. It also carries only the calls that
are actually IP-bound:

  * AUTH   — proven: GenAcsTok is refused from a non-whitelisted IP, while the
             browser login at trade.shoonya.com is not checked at all, so
             Selenium never needs the proxy.
  * ORDERS — SEBI's retail algo circular requires order placement to originate
             from the registered static IP. That is the whole point of the
             mandate: an audit trail tying each order to a known address.
  * DATA   — quotes and the websocket are ~19,000 requests a day and are not
             IP-restricted. Sending those through the proxy would multiply its
             load by a factor of several hundred for no benefit, so by default
             they stay direct.

Auth plus orders is on the order of fifty requests a day. That is the entire
cost of staying compliant while the heavy traffic stays off the proxy.

SHOONYA_PROXY may list several proxies, comma-separated. They are tried in order
until one is accepted, so losing a single proxy box — down, unreachable, or its
own IP dropped off Shoonya's whitelist — no longer breaks order flow. Each proxy
must itself sit on an IP registered with Shoonya; you gain redundancy only for as
many whitelisted IPs as you actually have.
